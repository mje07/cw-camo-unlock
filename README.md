# Camo Unlocker
Not my tool, the old repo didn't have low iq build instructions or a prebuilt so I figured I would add these here
- link for original tutorial: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3408246-post2246.html

Instructions:
Open Visual Studio
Open the solution once inside (specifically MemClass.sln)
Select from the top (Debug to Release, and CPU to x64)
Click Build Solution
The .exe should be located in \MemClass\obj\x64\Release
